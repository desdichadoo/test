Every time that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
Oh, it went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?

Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, oh, oh, oh
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin

You got to lose to know how to win
Half my life's in books' written pages
Storing facts learned from fools and from sages
You view the earth
